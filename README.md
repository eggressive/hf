## About <a name = "about"></a>

In this course, you’ll learn how to find and filter open source models on Hugging Face Hub to perform text, audio, image, and multimodal tasks using the Hugging Face transformers library. You’ll also learn to easily share your AI apps with a user-friendly interface or via API and run them locally and on the cloud using Gradio and Hugging Face Spaces.
